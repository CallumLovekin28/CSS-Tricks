#Font Awesome 

> "It makes it easy to add vector icons and social logos to your website."

###The easiest way to get started! 

Put your e-mail and Font Awesome CDN will send you a code to paste it in your HTML document.  

The code will look something like:   
> "< script src="https://use.fontawesome.com/f5166a862f.js"></script > "  

Remember, you have to paste it near the top of your HTML's < head >.
